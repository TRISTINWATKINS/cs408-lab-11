# Web Dev Starter Code
My Simple Inventory App
## Overview

This project is a web-based inventory management application that allows users to view, add, and delete items in a database. It uses AWS Lambda and API Gateway as the backend, with a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a dynamic table to display items and interactive forms for adding new inventory entries.

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:

- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
- jQuery: https://jquery.com/
- Background image: https://unsplash.com/photos/...
- Sound effects: https://freesound.org/people/...
- Icons: https://fontawesome.com/
- Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
- etc.



So I tried to work on this and no matter how long I sat trying to fix it and troubleshoot it i could not get it to work. At this point the project is late and still cant get it to work so Im sadly giveing up. Maybe Professor shane can help. I used F12 in the website to see whaty was wring and trioubleshoot from there but get these errors
